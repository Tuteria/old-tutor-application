            "When you get on a city bus, you start looking for a seat. If the front seats are taken, you move to the back. If you see that all seats are taken, so youâll have to stand, you should also move to the back. We all know this, and if we forget, weâre reminded by the driver, who continually yells âmove to the back.â The only way a city bus can fill up to carry all the passengers who want to ride is for standers to keep moving back. If one person stands in the middle of the bus instead of the back, then nobody can get past that person, and the whole back of the aisle is empty. The back of the bus is bereft of standers, while a zillion people are crowded into the front half. How many times have you been on a bus like this, or even seen it pass by you, refusing to stop because the driver thinks itâs full, when you can see room for 10 more people in the back?"
